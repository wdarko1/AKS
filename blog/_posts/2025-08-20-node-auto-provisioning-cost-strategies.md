## Introduction: Balancing Performance, Cost, and Scale

Running workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) often involves a delicate balance between performance, cost, and scalability. As organizations scale their applications, they face common challenges such as:

- **Overprovisioning** resources to handle peak loads
- **Idle nodes** consuming costs during low usage periods
- **Inefficient scaling** strategies that lead to unpredictable expenses

To address these challenges, compute optimization should be the starting point for any cost-saving strategy.

## Why Start with Compute Optimization?

Compute resources typically represent the largest portion of AKS costs. Optimizing how nodes are provisioned and scaled can lead to significant savings without compromising performance. This is where Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) comes into play.

## What is Node Auto Provisioning (NAP)?

Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) is a **generally available (GA)** feature in AKS that automatically provisions, scales, and managed workloads based on your requirements. It dynamically creates and scales virtual machines with the right VM sizes and configurations, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

With NAP, you can:

- Automatically provision nodes based on pod requirements
- Reduce idle capacity and overprovisioning


There are many ways you can 

## Azure Discounts: Reserved Instances vs. Savings Plans

Azure offers two primary discount models to reduce compute costs:

### Reserved Instances

Reserved Instances (RIs) provide significant discounts—up to 72%—for committing to a specific VM size and region for one or three years. This model is ideal for **stable workloads** with predictable usage patterns. For more information on Reserved Instances, check out the [Azure Reserved Instances documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/prepay-reserved-vm-instances)

### Savings Plans

Savings Plans offer flexible discounts—up to 65%—based on an hourly spend commitment, regardless of VM size or region. This model is best suited for **dynamic workloads** with unpredictable scaling needs.
